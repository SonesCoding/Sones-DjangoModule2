Theres an issue I know has a really dumb stupid solution, and I know the way the data will be displayed is 
wrong/rough I was just getting something out there. The form is not perfect. I hope after you look over my progress so far I can go ahead and clean up my templates/html, migrate, populate with my tables data, and then worry about the display of data/user input then.

I followed the django docs a lot, so I hope everything makes sense somewhat.
